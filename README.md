## About
This is a Meme Generator web application using the Vite web framework
 and React. The App component contains two subcomponents, 
 Header and Meme. The Header component is used to render the header 
 on the webpage. The Meme component consists of two text inputs, a 
 button input, and an image. The two text inputs currently don't work.
 The button is used to randomize the image underneath the button.
